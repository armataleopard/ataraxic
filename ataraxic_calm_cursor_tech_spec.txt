Technical Specification for Cursor Build — ATARAXIC ($calm)
=============================================================

PROJECT NAME: ATARAXIC
TICKER: $calm

GENERAL IDEA
-------------
A hilarious therapy-themed memecoin site with intentional chaos and offbeat irony. 
Should feel like an accidental meeting between a ghost, a therapist, and the crypto market.
Style from cartoons to eerie serenity — but with simplicity of structure (no mega scrolls or complex interactions).

STYLE GUIDE
------------
- Color Palette: pastel therapy office colors + neon ghostly green and soft pink for accents
- Font: Rounded cartoon-style headers, basic sans-serif for text
- Atmosphere: cozy absurdity, low-effort therapy office
- Design: minimal components, strong aesthetic, max immersion

STRUCTURE OVERVIEW
--------------------
1. **HEADER (Centered Logo)**
   - Image: logo.jpg
   - Text: “ATARAXIC ($calm)”
   - Animation: ghost icon loops in lazy floating

2. **HERO BANNER (fullscreen section)**
   - banner.png as blurred background
   - Overlay title: "You’re not just broke. You’re transcendently calm."
   - Button: [Join our therapy group] → links to Telegram
   - Button: [Share trauma] → opens tweet intent with prefilled text “I just bought $calm and now I hear voices”

3. **GHOST SESSION SLIDES**
   - 3 slides, style как у mem-психотерапии
   - Slide 1: ghost looking at chart + caption “This is fine”
   - Slide 2: ghost therapist taking notes with checklist like “Buy $calm”, “Meditate”, “Panic again”
   - Slide 3: “Portfolio: 0 :)” on vintage monitor

4. **JOKEY TOKENOMICS BLOCK**
   - Title: “CALMonomics”
   - 3 Icons: Ghosts, Candles, Burned wallets
   - Text:
     - Supply: yes
     - Allocation: we don’t talk about that
     - LP: locked inside the therapist’s drawer

5. **SHORT NARRATIVE SECTION**
   - Title: “Why we exist”
   - Text: Short story of a ghost who held too long and found peace in the red zone (funny, max 100 words)
   - Floating gif sticker of crying ghost goes up/down while scrolling

6. **FOOTER**
